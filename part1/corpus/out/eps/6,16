ACT ONE

Scene One  Caf Nervosa
Niles comes into the Caf just as Frasier is saying goodbye to 
another man, who leaves.

Frasier: Hello, Niles. 
  Niles: Frasier, was that the author Dr. Gordon Edelstein?
Frasier: Yes.
  Niles: I wasn't aware you knew him!
Frasier: Yes, well, we just met.  You see, the station is hiring 
         another call-in psychiatrist for a one-week trial period, 
         and they've asked me to choose among the finalists.
  Niles: Well, he'd be wonderful!  I just finished his book on the 
         victims of obsessive-compulsive disorder. [wiping down his 
         chair] Poor, tic-ridden devils! [sits]
Frasier: Niles, before you take out your utensil chamois, I've got to 
         tell you I have another interview in just a few minutes, all 
         right?  Though it's going to be tough to top Dr. Edelstein.
  Niles: I must say, you're taking this rather well.
Frasier: What do you mean.
  Niles: Many people in your position would feel threatened at the 
         thought of... well, another cat sharing the litter-box.
Frasier: Your flattering analogy aside, Niles, I take it as a tribute.  
         Obviously, the station is so pleased with my show that they're 
         looking for more of the same.  They could hardly ask me to do 
         another three hours.  Imagine how exhausting that would be.
  Niles: And for you as well.  Anyway, moving on to me, what's the 
         verdict?
Frasier: Verdict?
  Niles: On my new look.  I must say, you deserve some of the credit.
Frasier: Really?
  Niles: Well, yes, you keep saying I should accept Daphne's 
         relationship with Donny and find a paramour of my own.  
         Well, the hunt is on!  I thought to bolster my self-esteem 
         I would adopt this raffish new look!
Frasier: Well, it suits you.  Dashing, and yet understated, and, uh... 
         oh, I give up, what are we talking about?
  Niles: My mustache. [stretches his upper lip] I grant you, it's at 
         an early stage.
Frasier: What stage, Research & Development?

A blond woman in a smart suit comes into the caf.

   Nora: Dr. Crane?  Dr. Nora Fairchild.
Frasier: Oh yes, of course.  Welcome.
   Nora: I can't tell you what a privilege this is.  I listened to 
         your show today, and I was amazed!  I hope that doesn't 
         sound too fawning.
Frasier: Oh, fawning is just fine.  Fawning is fun!
   Nora: I hope I'm not interrupting another interview?
Frasier: No, no, this is my brother, Niles Crane.  He was just about 
         to leave.
   Nora: I should have known you two were brothers.  The same superb 
         fashion sense, the same refined yet masculine good looks. 
         [to Niles] You must be so proud of your kid brother, the 
         radio star.
  Niles: Well, yes.  Congratulations on your new job, I hope you'll 
         be very happy at KACL.
   Nora: Isn't that a bit premature?
  Niles: Oh well, let's just say I know my little brother.

Scene Two  KACL
Frasier and Kenny (the station manager) issue Dr. Nora in, followed 
by her producer, George.

   Nora: I want to thank you both for making me and my producer feel 
         so welcome.  Is everyone around here as friendly as you two?
Frasier: Well...

Roz, catching sight of George, comes out of her booth and cozies up.

    Roz: Well, hello there!
Frasier: Some are even friendlier.  This is my producer, Roz Doyle.
   Nora: Dr. Nora, and this is my producer, George.
    Roz: Nice to meet you.
 George: Hello.
    Roz: Follow me and I'll give you the lay of the land.

She leads George into her booth.

Frasier: Let's just hope that's a figure of speech, not a sales pitch.  
         Well, Nora, please, please, do come in, make yourself at home. 
         [she sits in his chair] Here we are, get settled in.  Here's 
         your headset, of course the phone lines, everything's pretty 
         self-explanatory, cough button, on-air button.  Listen, I want 
         you to remember it's all right to be nervous.  Even my first 
         show was a tad bumpy.
  Kenny: "Bumpy?" [laughs] It was a train wreck!  "Medic, we got 
         incoming!"
Frasier: Yes, thank you, Kenny.  As I recall, you weren't even here 
         then.
  Kenny: Oh, I got a tape of it from my Secret Santa.  Break a leg, 
         Dr. Nora.
   Nora: Thank you.
Frasier: I'll get out of your hair.  Godspeed, Dr. Nora.

She smiles at him.  He leaves the booth and closes the door.  Out in 
the hall, he claps with anticipation.  Roz sees him.

    Roz: What are you smirking about?
Frasier: Oh, gosh, it's just so much fun to have a protg.  You see 
         the way she behaves towards me?  It's like a shy Japanese 
         novice bowing before her Frasier sensei!
    Roz: I feel a bow coming on myself.  Could you pass me that 
         wastebasket?
Frasier: Stop it!  Shh, she's about to start.  I just want to catch 
         the beginning, make sure she's got those first-show jitters 
         under control.

In the booth, Nora finished introducing herself.

   Nora: All right, let's get right to our first caller.  Whom do we 
         have?
 George: We have Jenny from Tacoma on line one.
   Nora: Hello, Jenny, I'm Dr. Nora and I'm here to help.
  Jenny: [v.o.] Hi, Dr. Nora.  My boyfriend and I have been living 
         together for about two years
   Nora: Are you having sex?
  Jenny: Our sex life's not the problem, it's great.  But whenever 
         I mention marriage he changes the subject.  Do you think 
         that he's afraid of commitment?
   Nora: No, that's it.  Let me help you see this from a different 
         perspective. 

In the hall, Frasier and Roz have seen enough, and walk down the hall.

   Nora: You're a whore, Jenny.

Frasier and Roz rush back and stare through the glass.

  Jenny: Huh?  A-a whore?!
   Nora: You're sleeping with a man you're not married to.  In my book, 
         that's a whore.
  Jenny: I-I'm not a whore!  I'm a flight attendant!
   Nora: Oh, you think there's no overlap?

She laughs at her joke.  George grins.

    Roz: Well, she's got her jitters under control!

In the booth:

   Nora: Wake up, Jenny, you've blown it!  Dump this creep!  Find a 
         new guy, and until you're Mrs. New Guy you keep those knees 
         together, OK?  Staple them!  I don't care if you have to hop 
         to the altar! [laughs] God bless, honey.  Who's next?

In the hall, Frasier is reeling at what he's unleashed.

Scene Three  Apartment
Daphne is drying dishes in the kitchen.  Niles walks in.

  Niles: Hello, Daphne.
 Daphne: Hello.
  Niles: Notice anything?
 Daphne: [pause, then] Oh yes, don't you look dashing!  Blue really is 
         your color.  Hold still, though, there's something on your 
         lip. [holds his chin and wipes his lip with the dishrag] Oh, 
         wait, it's some sort of hair.
  Niles: Actually, it's a mustache.
 Daphne: Oh yes, so it is.  Still a bit on the wispy side.  Yeah, puts 
         me in mind of my Grammy Moon.  Or rather it will, once it's 
         grown in a bit.

They go out into the living room, Martin is reading the paper.  
Frasier comes in.

Frasier: Turn on the radio.
 Martin: Something the matter?
Frasier: Just turn the radio on to KACL, please.

Daphne does.

   Nora: [v.o.] Listen to me, you have a child!  You think you have the 
         right to get divorced just because you're tired of your 
         husband?
   Jill: [v.o.] But he's gay!
   Nora: You picked him.  You made a baby with him.  Maybe you got him 
         drunk, maybe you dressed up as Antonio Banderas, I don't care!  
         Just make it work!

Daphne turns off the radio.


  Niles: Well, that's a bit harsh!
Frasier: Oh, please.  This is a woman who believes the Spanish 
         Inquisition was just tough love for heretics!
 Martin: You know, we were listening to her while I was doing my 
         exercises, and I don't think she's so bad.
Frasier: Excuse me?!
 Martin: Well, it's nice to have someone stand up for old-fashioned 
         values.  Like sex.  I mean, I'm no prude, but in my day sex 
         was still something sacred, and mysterious.  Nowadays, you 
         can't even turn on the television without seeing all this 
         "Ooh-ooh, Ah-ah" stuff!
Frasier: Well, I think that explains our ninety dollar cable bill 
         this month!

Martin covers his face with the paper.

 Daphne: I liked her too.  She reminds me of my old mum.  She'll point 
         out every little flaw you've got, remind you of every mistake 
         you ever made, tell you you're lazy, you'll never amount to 
         anything, and no good man will ever have you.  But, it's just 
         because she loves you!  In fact, I think I'll give old Mum a 
         call!

Daphne goes to her room.

 Martin: You know, if you hate her so much, why did you hire her?
Frasier: Well, I didn't know she was going to behave this way!  She 
         said all the right things at the interview.
  Niles: Ho-ho, she certainly did!  She complimented his clothes, his 
         looks, she even pretended to believe I was the older brother.  
         Of course, the mustache may have clouded her judgment on that.
 Martin: She has a mustache?
Frasier: Well, like it or not, I am responsible for her being here.  
         I'll just have to have a talk with her.  Tell her to soften 
         her approach a bit before she alienates her entire audience.  
         I mean, really, people can tell the difference between 
         constructive criticism and outright abuse!

Daphne crosses the room with the cordless phone.

 Daphne: No, Mum, my boyfriend hasn't dumped me for someone prettier 
         and smarter yet! [laughs; to the gang] She's such an old 
         tease.

DR. RUTHLESS

Scene Four  KACL
Frasier is finishing his show.

Frasier: Until tomorrow, then, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.

He goes off the air.  Dr. Nora comes in.

Frasier: Ah, Dr. Nora.
   Nora: Such a frosty tone.  Is something the matter?
Frasier: I have just one question

Roz storms in from her booth.
  
    Roz: What kind of vicious, judgmental, name-calling, machete-
         mouthed bitch are you?
Frasier: I was going for the less feisty version.
    Roz: I heard what you said to that single mother yesterday.  
         For your information, I happen to be a single mom too.
   Nora: That doesn't surprise me after watching you pounce on poor 
         George like a Kodiak bear on a salmon.
    Roz: That does it...!
Frasier: Roz, Roz, stop it!  I have to talk to Dr. Nora before her 
         show.  Now, just pencil the hair-pulling for later, all right?
    Roz: All right. [to Nora] But this isn't over between us.  If you 
         want, I'll take this out on the street.
   Nora: That would hardly be fair.  You'd have the home field 
         advantage. [laughs]

Roz lunges, but Frasier holds her back and shoos her out of the booth.

Frasier: Well, I don't even know where to begin.
   Nora: Save it.  Whatever it is, I've already heard it.  "Dr. Nora 
         is mean, Dr. Nora hurts people's feelings."  Well, too bad.  
         I'm not here to coddle people, I'm here to help them.
Frasier: Oh, really?  And just how were you helping that poor, confused 
         bisexual woman by calling her an "equal-opportunity slut?"  
         You know, the worst thing about this is how you misrepresented 
         yourself to get this job.
   Nora: You're hardly one to question my ethics.  We both know you 
         hired me because you hoped I might sleep with you.
Frasier: That thought never occurred to me!
   Nora: Now who's lying?  You won't admit that, like most men, you 
         leave all major decisions to your penis.  Fortunately for 
         Seattle, your penis chose right.  It just didn't know why.
Frasier: Yes, well, you're just forgetting one thing, Dr. Nora.  You 
         are here on my recommendation, you may consider it withdrawn.

Kenny comes in.

  Kenny: Hey, Dr. Crane.
Frasier: Ah, Kenny, just the man I wanted to see.
  Kenny: Dr. Nora  don't hit me! [laughs]
Frasier: I want to talk to you about Dr. Nora's show.
  Kenny: Yeah, well, get in line.  The switchboards were going nuts.
Frasier: I don't doubt it.
  Kenny: They love you!
Frasier: Excuse me?!
  Kenny: Well, except for the ones that hate you.  But either way, 
         they're listening.  So you consider that option picked up.
 George: Ten seconds.
   Nora: Thank you, Kenny.  Now get out of my booth.
  Kenny: [acting scared] Ooh! [then, obedient] Yes, ma'am.

Kenny and Frasier leave the booth.

Frasier: Kenny, you can't be serious about hiring that woman full-time!  
         Putting that woman behind a microphone is like putting Typhoid 
         Mary in a kissing booth!
  Kenny: I'm sorry, Doc.  Ratings are ratings.

In the booth:

    Tom: [v.o.] Hi, Dr. Nora, my name is Tom, and I have this co-worker 
         who's really driving me up the wall.  What can I do about it?
   Nora: Not a thing, Tom.  Not one damn thing.

She smirks over her shoulder at Frasier.  Furious, he leaves.

END OF ACT ONE

ACT TWO

Scene Five - KACL.
Frasier is on the air with a woman, Denise.  Dr. Nora watches from 
the hallway.

 Denise: [v.o.] Nothing I ever do is good enough for her.  I baked a 
         cake for her birthday, and she said it tasted like sawdust.  
         I know she's my mother, but sometimes I just want to shut 
         her out of my life.
Frasier: Oh, Denise, burning bridges solves nothing.  I'd like to 
         suggest that you seek family counseling to help you and your 
         mother get to the root of some of these issues, provided your 
         mother's willing to cooperate.  If not, perhaps individual 
         counseling would help.  Will you stay on the line so Roz can 
         give you some numbers?
 Denise: O.K.  Thank you, Dr. Crane.
Frasier: It's my pleasure. [looks over his shoulder and sees Nora's 
         sour look] Well, I see through the glass that Dr. Nora either 
         disagrees with me or has just eaten a bad clam.  I'm sure 
         she'll tell us which when the Dr. Nora show begins right after 
         this traffic report from Chopper Dave.

He goes off the air, picks up his briefcase and goes into Roz's
booth.  George also comes in and selects some carts.  Nora comes into 
Frasier's booth and sits down.

    Roz: O.K., Denise, I've got some numbers for you.  Do you have a 
         pen?
Frasier: Come on, Roz, hurry up.  I'd like to get out of here before 
         her trainer shows up with a bucket of live mice for her pre-
         show feeding.

In the other booth, Nora immediately hits "On-Air."

   Nora: I'm sorry to cut you off, Chopper Dave, but we have a therapy 
         emergency.  Denise, are you still on?
 Denise: Yes.
Frasier: That's my caller!
   Nora: Denise, I want you to ignore everything Dr. Crane just told 
         you.  I know a lot more about mothers that he does, and here 
         is Fact #1: they don't change.  Cut this woman out of your 
         life.
Frasier: I don't believe this!
 Denise: You don't think that with counseling
   Nora: Denise, when you have a tumor, what do you do?  Do you sit it 
         down and say, "Hey, tumor, let's get along, O.K.?"  No, you 
         take a knife and cut it out!  Well, Denise, your mother is a 
         tumor.  My heart bleeds for you, because I have been there, 
         and I know how hard it is to look at your own mother's face 
         and say, "Bye-bye, you toxic harpy!  You are not hurting me 
         again!"  But that is what you have to do.

Frasier angrily picks up the phone in the producer's booth and 
dials.

 Denise: I think maybe you're right.
   Nora: I'm always right.  And you know what else?  I bet your cake 
         was yummy.  God bless, honey.  Who's next?
 George: We have Frasier, from here.
Frasier: [over booth phone] How dare you ambush Denise that way?
   Nora: Oh well, what a surprise.  I dare to give one of Frasier's 
         callers a second opinion, and what does Frasier say?

She plays a SFX cart of a baby crying.

Frasier: Ah, yes, sound effects!  The therapist's best friend!  You 
         realize what you're doing is completely unprofessional?  
         Denise called my show, she didn't ask for your opinion!
   Nora: And I didn't ask for yours. [disconnects] Back to you, 
         Chopper Dave.
Frasier: She cut me off! [storms into the booth] All right, let's just 
         settle this.  We don't like each other.  But we're going to 
         have to coexist here.  So why don't we agree that I won't 
         criticize you, and you won't criticize me.  Do we have a deal?
   Nora: No.
Frasier: No?!
   Nora: No, I will undermine you every chance I get, because you, 
         Dr. Crane, are a dangerous man!
Frasier: I'm dangerous?!
   Nora: Yes.  Seattle's Great Enabler.  You tell tramps and fornicators 
         that their problem is low self-esteem.  They should have low 
         self-esteem, they're going to hell!
Frasier: I take it back!  You're not unprofessional  you're a freaking 
         loon!
 George: Five seconds.

Frasier goes back into George's booth and grabs his briefcase.

Frasier: All right, if it's war you two want, it's war you'll get!  
         Right, Roz?!

Frasier storms out of the booth.

    Roz: You don't actually buy all this "no sex" stuff of hers, do you?
 George: Yeah.
    Roz: Well, it's WAR!

Roz storms out of the booth.

"M" IS FOR THE MANY WAYS 
I'D MAIM HER

Scene Six  Apartment
The doorbell rings.  Martin opens the door to Niles.

 Martin: Oh hi, Niles.
  Niles: Hey, Dad.  You probably noticed I shaved my mustache.

As Niles comes in, Martin stands puzzled for a moment.

  Niles: I decided a better way to change my look was to pump some iron.
 Martin: Ah.  So what, you joined a gym?
  Niles: I certainly did.  I start the minute my weight belt gets back 
         from the monogrammer's.

Frasier comes out of the hall.

  Niles: Oh, Frasier, you free for dinner?
Frasier: Well, I suppose so, yes.

Daphne comes in the door with a basket of laundry, followed by Roz 
with some files.

 Daphne: Hey, look who I bumped into in the elevator.
Frasier: Roz!
    Roz: I've been on the phone all day, digging up dirt on Dr. Nora, 
         and you will not believe what I found!
Frasier: Really?
    Roz: I called the station where she used to work, and they couldn't 
         wait to dish her! [opens the file] For starters, she has no 
         medical degree.
Frasier: What?
    Roz: Her doctorate is in Physical Education!
Frasier: [ecstatic] She's a GYM TEACHER!
  Niles: Wouldn't want to be the chubby kid in that gym class.
 Martin: Or the boy in the monogrammed weight belt.
Frasier: Well, this is just dynamite, Roz!
    Roz: Oh, that's not even half of it.  Her name isn't Fairchild, 
         she was born Mulhern, and Little Miss Family Values has two 
         divorces behind her, and an affair with a married man!
Frasier: Tomorrow, I am going to drop this little bombshell to start 
         my show, and end hers!
 Martin: You know, Fras, when I was on the force, I went through a feud 
         like this with Charlie Drucker, and believe me it's not worth 
         it.  I started out by making a joke about his chest.
 Daphne: His chest?
 Martin: Yeah, he was like a heavyset guy, and he had those, you know, 
         "man-bosoms."  So, he heard about it, and he got mad at me, 
         and he wrote something about me on the men's room wall, and 
         I should have just called it quits right there and then.  But 
         his name being "Drucker" brought out the poet in me.  Then it 
         just got worse and worse, and we both ended up looking like 
         idiots.
Frasier: Well, Dad, I don't intend to get into a feud with her.  I just 
         want to get her off the air.
  Niles: Yeah, but if you attack her like that, aren't you just 
         descending to her level?
Frasier: You know, Roz, maybe they're right.  I mean, look at what 
         this woman has reduced me to already.  Trading barbs, 
         yelling over the air.  Now I'm spreading rumors about her?  
         Is that anyway for a psychiatrist to deal with conflict?
    Roz: Don't you wimp out on me!
Frasier: Now, Roz, just think about it.  There may be a better way.  
         You know, Dr. Nora is clearly a damaged and angry woman.  
         Maybe I could find out what's at the root of that anger, and 
         help her, also proving that my method of therapy is the more 
         valid one.
    Roz: Why are you doing this to me?!  Look, if you have a tumor
Frasier: Roz, stop it!
  Niles: You know, if you want to analyze her, you might start with 
         that whole mother thing.  I caught her show yesterday, and 
         that certainly seemed to be a hot-button issue.
Frasier: Yes, it did, didn't it?  They've been estranged for years.  
         You know, perhaps we could find the woman and discover what 
         caused this rift between them.
  Niles: Maybe even effect a reconciliation.
Frasier: Of course, it won't be easy.  We don't even know if the 
         woman's still alive.

Daphne is folding the laundry.

 Daphne: Yes, all sorts of things could happen to a woman her age.  
         Her mother could have had a heart attack, or a stroke.
Frasier: Exactly.
 Daphne: [continuing merrily] She could be hit by a bus as she's coming 
         out of the pub.  Or fall asleep smoking a cigarette and be 
         burned to a crisp right there in her smelly bed!  Or she could 
         fall off a ferry and be pulled down under the water, the roar 
         of the waves drowning out her cries for help, until no one 
         could hear that shrill voice of hers, not ever again! 
         [finishes folding the laundry] Well, I'm all done with my 
         darks.

She leaves the room, oblivious to the others' stares.

Scene Seven - KACL
Nora is roasting her latest caller.

   Nora: Listen to me!  You should be shunning this woman, not rewarding 
         her with gifts! [disconnects] A baby shower for an unwed 
         mother?  Now I've heard it all.  Who's next?

In the hall, Roz is watching.  Frasier comes up.

Frasier: Roz, did her mother get here all right?
    Roz: Yes, but I'm begging you!  We could drive a stake through that 
         thing's heart right now!

Frasier pushes her down the hallway.

Frasier: Roz, Roz, please trust me, my way is better.  Get in here.

They come into a waiting room, where an elderly woman is seated.

[N.B. Piper Laurie played a guest caller in [1.13], 
"Guess Who's Coming to Breakfast."]

Frasier: Ah, Mrs. Mulhern.  I'm Dr. Frasier Crane, it's such a pleasure 
         to meet you.
Mulhern: Oh, Dr. Crane, I can't thank you enough for finding me and 
         bringing me here.
Frasier: Well, I was so moved by your story.  It's a joy to do this 
         for you.
Mulhern: For twenty years I wondered where my little girl was, and 
         if I'd ever see her again.
    Roz: What did you two fight about to begin with?
Mulhern: Oh, I blame myself.  I thought the man she wanted to marry 
         wasn't good enough for her, so she eloped.  And I've been 
         so afraid the emphysema would finish me before I could ask 
         her forgiveness and tell her I love her.
Frasier: [nearly in tears] Well, tell her you shall.  Roz?

Frasier goes into the producer's booth and picks up the phone:

   Nora: Forget couples' therapy, Allison.  He is a loser!  If you 
         don't drop him right now, you deserve every bit of misery 
         you get!  God bless, honey.  Who's next?
 George: We have Frasier Crane on line one.
   Nora: Frasier, you want to yell at me for that last call?
Frasier: No, although I do believe that a gifted therapist can help 
         two people put aside their anger and heal the differences 
         between them.
   Nora: Blah, blah, blah.
Frasier: I have someone here with me today, someone you haven't seen 
         for quite a while.  There's something she'd like to tell you, 
         something she's wanted to tell you for a very, very long time.

Roz shows Mrs. Mulhern in.  Frasier lowers the receiver so Nora 
doesn't hear him say:

Frasier: Mrs. Mulhern?

Mrs. Mulhern goes into the radio booth and stands behind Nora.

Mulhern: You little whore!

Four sets of jaws drop  Frasier's, Roz's, George's, and Nora's.

   Nora: MOTHER!
Mulhern: So, you thought you could get away from me, did you?  Thought 
         you could leave me to rot in that dump without barely enough 
         cash for a bottle of Mateus!  You'll pay for that, missy!
    Roz: [jumping for joy] I was wrong, Frasier!  Your way IS better!

Frasier tries to enter the booth.

Frasier: Mrs. Mulhern
Mulhern: [shoves him out and locks the door] Keep out of this!
   Nora: M-Mother, please!  I am doing my show!
Mulhern: Yes, you're Little Miss Perfect now, aren't you?  Telling 
         everybody else how wicked they are!  They should hear about 
         your past!

Frasier tries to enter through the other door.

Frasier: Mrs. Mulhern, please!

She shoves him out and locks the other door.

Mulhern: The shame you brought on me, you ungrateful tramp!
   Nora: [crying] Mother, please, I'm a good girl now.
Mulhern: How you were paid  paid!  to leave town, by that nice boy's 
         family.
Frasier: For God's sake, Nora, go to commercial!
   Nora: There, Seattle, now you know what I mean when I say there 
         are some people you just don't need in your life! [goes to 
         commercial] Help me out, George!

She throws off her headphones and rushes into the producer's booth.

Mulhern: What are they paying you here?  I want my cut!

George closes the door and fights to hold it shut.

   Nora: I knew that you hated me, but I just can't believe you 
         could be so cruel!
Frasier: I was trying to help!  She seemed delightful on the phone!
Mulhern: [knocking on the glass] I want fifty dollars right now!
   Nora: HOW MANY TIMES WILL I HAVE TO MOVE BEFORE I'M FINALLY FREE 
         OF HER?!

She runs out into the hallway.  Mrs. Mulhern goes out the other door 
to head her off.

Frasier: [yelling after her] Nora, I'm sorry!
Mulhern: [yelling after her] You owe me, missy!  I gave you life!

Nora screams like a madwoman.  George runs out after them.

    Roz: Frasier, we've got dead air!

Frasier goes into the radio booth.  Roz shuts the doors and grabs 
some carts.

Frasier: [hits "On Air"] Hello, this is Dr. Frasier Crane.  I'm sure 
         Dr. Nora's listeners join me in hoping she and her mother 
         can resolve these differences very soon.  They're off to a 
         bit of a bumpy start

Nora screams again as the chase takes them by the booth.

Frasier: But... at least the lines of communication are open!

Another scream comes, louder and clearly audible over the air.  
Frasier can only gape at Roz.

Credits: 

Daphne is tenderizing a steak with a mallet and talking on the phone 
with her mother.  She tries to protest, but can't get a word in 
edgewise, so she just listens, nodding.

As soon as she hangs up, she goes radge on the steak, pounding the 
stuffing out of it.
