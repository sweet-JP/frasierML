ACT ONE

Scene One - Apartment
Frasier & Martin are sitting in their apartment as Daphne walks 
through the door laughing with Donny.

 Martin: Oh, hey!  How was your afternoon?
 Daphne: Do you know what this wonderful man did?
  Donny: [modest] Oh Daphne, please don't...
 Daphne: [shushes him, then] He filled a basket full of my favorite 
         English foods: blood pudding, jellied eels, kidney pie.  
         And then he hid it in the shrub so we'd stumble upon it during 
         our stroll through the park.
  Donny: I was only a little afraid that somebody would find it before 
         we got there, but fortunately - [off basket] untouched. 
Frasier: Yes, well just because it was untouched doesn't mean someone
         didn't find it.

Niles enters the room from the kitchen.

 Daphne: Hello, Dr. Crane.
  Niles: [happily] Hello, Daphne. [much less enthusiastic] Donny. 
  Donny: Hey, Tiger.  Look what I've got for you.  Think fast.

Donny throws Niles some keys, however as usual he doesn't think fast 
and the keys go flying off.  Frasier picks them up and hands them to 
Niles.

  Niles: What are the keys to?
  Donny: Your ex-wife's lakefront cottage, now YOUR lakefront cottage. 
         A little something I hammered out for you in the settlement.
  Niles: Thank you, Donny!  I never thought I'd see "Shady Glen" again. 

Donny & Daphne kiss at the door.  Donny leaves and Daphne walks over 
to the other side of the room.

Frasier: Well, congratulations, Niles.
 Martin: Yeah, looks like Donny really did a job on Maris's legal team!
  Niles: Yes, well he certainly is ruthless all right. [in Daphne's
         earshot] As a divorce lawyer, what a callous attitude he must 
         have towards human relationships.
 Daphne: Yeah, you'd think so, Dr. Crane, but actually he's just the
         opposite.  I've never met anyone so incredibly romantic.
         [leaves to her room]
  Niles: [shouting] Yes, well I'm sure he seems that way on the 
         OUTSIDE...
Frasier: [sternly] Niles!  Please, stop what you're doing.  It's 
         unseemly enough when she's actually in the room! 
  Niles: Oh, I'm sorry, what am I supposed to do?  For the first time
         since I've known her I'm free and single and now she's with
         someone.  Am I supposed to just suffer in silence?
 Martin: I'd take that!
  Niles: I just don't understand, what does she see in him? [to Frasier] 
         If you were Daphne, would you go out with Donny?
Frasier: Well no, but I wouldn't massage Dad's ass for what I pay her
         either! 

Martin looks offended, while Niles nods in agreement.

Frasier: Look, I'm sorry, Niles, it's just that Donny and Daphne seem 
         very happy together.  Now either it's true love, in which case 
         it's too late for you to declare yourself, or it's just a 
         temporary infatuation-
  Niles: [jumping with hope] It's got to be!  It's got to be!
Frasier: ...In which case it will pass, and then you can make your move!  
         And in the mean time I suggest that maybe you start looking 
         elsewhere.  You know, maybe make a fresh start, do something 
         to get your mind off of Daphne.
  Niles: I know, I know, it's just difficult.
Frasier: Yes, I understand that... say, you know what, I've got an idea.  
         Why don't the three of us go up to that new cabin of yours for 
         the weekend?
 Martin: Oh sorry, I can't.  I've got a dentist appointment Saturday         
         morning. 
Frasier: Well, that's all right, Dad.  Niles can go up on Friday night, 
         put things together, and then you and I can drive up on 
         Saturday afternoon.
  Niles: [excited] Why not?  It's a fabulous place, Dad.  It's got a
         stereo and a big screen TV, and a sauna, wine cellar...
Frasier: [laughs] Perfect for three guys roughing it in the wilderness!
 Martin: Well, I'm game.
Frasier: You know what?  I can stop at the butcher, I'll pick up a 
         couple of ducks and make my justly celebrated duck a l'orange.
  Niles: Washed down with a winsome yet robust Chambertin?
Frasier: Chambertin!
 Martin: Yeah, and I'll bring a quart of whiskey in case of snakebite.
  Niles: Dad, Dad, there are no snakes up there.
 Martin: [feeling happy] All right, I'll bring a snake! [leaves to
         his room]
Frasier: God, this is great, Niles!  You know what, I've got to dash 
         down to the mailbox to drop that letter in before the last 
         pickup.  Niles, trust me, you'll be glad you took my advice 
         on this one.
  Niles: I already am, thank you, Frasier.  It's going to do me a 
         world of good to get away from Daphne for a while.
Frasier: Yes, I couldn't agree more. 

He leaves as Daphne enters from her bedroom.

  Niles: Hey Daphne, how'd you like to see my new lakefront cottage?

They enter the kitchen where she potters about.

 Daphne: Sounds lovely, when?
  Niles: This weekend.  We're all going.  You can drive up with me on
         Friday, and Dad and Frasier will be... right behind.
 Daphne: Well, that's very sweet, Dr. Crane, but I can't.  One of my 
         cousins is going to San Francisco this weekend and I promised 
         I'd fly down. 
  Niles: That's a shame.
 Daphne: Yeah, Donny's not too thrilled about it either.  He wanted to
         come with me.
  Niles: And he's not?
 Daphne: No.  That would have meant staying in a hotel together, and 
         I'm not sure we're ready for that yet.  I suppose you think 
         I'm being a bit old-fashioned.
  Niles: [ecstatic from the news] Dear God in heaven, no!
 Daphne: You can't force these things, you have to wait for the moment 
         when you know it's right.
  Niles: [hopeful] Yes, and sometimes the moment never comes and you
         just have to move on.
 Daphne: But I really appreciate the invitation and I'll hope you'll 
         invite me again. 
  Niles: [joking] All right.  Daphne, how'd you like to see my new
         lakefront cottage?
 Daphne: Silly!

Daphne laughs with him and hits him on the shoulder as a joke.  He 
jokily hits her back.  They do this for a while, reminiscent of the 
"Heart & Soul" scene in "First Date."  

However, once she leaves Niles slaps the counter, feeling depressed.

FADE OUT

THIS COULD BE THE START
OF SOMETHING WEIRD

Scene Two  Caf Nervosa
On Friday afternoon, Martin and Niles are sitting in Caf Nervosa when 
Roz arrives.

    Roz: Martin, Niles!  Boy, this place is jammed.
 Martin: Oh hey, Roz. [stands up and hands seat over] You can have my
         seat, I'm on my way to Duke's.  Yeah so, how's the world 
         treating you?
    Roz: Like dirt!  My social life is nonexistent.  Every time I meet 
         a guy who's halfway decent all I have to do is mention I've
         got a kid and he runs like a cheap pair of pantyhose.
 Martin: Oh-ho... well, maybe you and Niles can cheer each other up. 
  Niles: [nervous] Dad...
    Roz: Why, what's his problem?
 Martin: Oh, Daphne's got a new boyfriend and it's eating him up.
  Niles: Dad!
    Roz: What? [to Niles] You've got a thing for Daphne?
 Martin: What, you didn't know that after all these years?
    Roz: No!  I can't believe Daphne never told me.
 Martin: Well, how could she?  She doesn't know either.
    Roz: You're kidding! [they laugh]
  Niles: Yes, yes, he's a great kidder.  Now, you Dad, run along, and 
         you be very careful crossing streets! 
 Martin: [to Roz] Six years, can you believe it?  Some people just 
         don't even know when it's time to pull the plug. [leaves]
  Niles: [shouting after him] Well, I won't make that mistake twice!

Martin laughs on his way out.  Roz commences grilling Niles.

    Roz: So let me get this straight...
  Niles: [moaning] Oh...
    Roz: You've been hot for Daphne all this time and you never made a 
         move?
  Niles: I was a happily married man.
    Roz: You were never happy and you've been separated for almost two
         years! 
  Niles: Well... somehow the right moment never came along.
    Roz: Oh, come on.  I-I'm not trying to make you feel bad, it's 
         just... waiting all this time and now she's got a boyfriend? 
         [chuckles] My God, that is really pathetic! [laughs]
  Niles: Obviously you've never let someone you've grown to care deeply 
         about get away.
    Roz: Well, sure I have. 
  Niles: I'm not talking about when the migrant workers leave at the
         end of the picking season.
    Roz: [gives him a "very nice" look, then] No really, I've had a 
         couple of boyfriends I shouldn't have let get away. 
  Niles: Serious relationships?
    Roz: Yeah.  In fact, I can name one right off the top of my head:
         that lawyer I gave you, Donny?
  Niles: Really?
    Roz: Yeah.  I mean, you only know him professionally, but he's very
         funny, warm, thoughtful. [smiling] We were together for about 
         six months, but he really wanted a family and I wasn't ready, 
         so I dumped him.  Now I have a family but no Donny.  Gee, I 
         wonder who he's seeing these days?

Niles breaks into smug laughter.

    Roz: What's so funny?
  Niles: I'll tell you in a minute. [laughing] I just want to savor it, 
         you've been having all the fun!
    Roz: So tell me! [laughs with him]
  Niles: Donny's Daphne's boyfriend.
    Roz: [stops laughing] That's not funny!  When did this happen?
  Niles: Well, she met him when he was working on my case.
    Roz: [sighs] Wow, and I was calling you a loser.
  Niles: You never called me a loser.
    Roz: In my head I did!
  Niles: Well, at the moment I have to agree with you.  I've had plenty 
         of opportunities and I've always chickened out.
    Roz: Oh, don't blame yourself.  She's living with your brother,
         working for your dad - it's an awkward situation. 
  Niles: It is!  Well... don't feel bad about Donny.  It wasn't right
         for you at the time, that's nobody's fault.
    Roz: Thanks, Niles.  Hey listen, the next time you find somebody 
         you like, don't wait so long to tell her. [looks at watch and
         gets up] Oh, I've got a babysitter waiting.  Mrs. Hines is
         seventy years old and has a mole like Abe Lincoln but I bet
         SHE has plans for the weekend!
  Niles: You know what, I just had the craziest idea.  My settlement
         with Maris includes a  beautiful lakefront cottage and I'm
         going up there this afternoon.  Why don't you come along?  You
         can bring Alice.
    Roz: [sits back down] Are you serious?
  Niles: Well, Frasier and Dad are coming up tomorrow, but tonight it'd
         just be us: Love's losers licking our wounds, laughing at our
         pain.
    Roz: Gee, I don't know..
  Niles: Well, Frasier's making duck a L'orange and I'm bringing the
         wine.  What about it?
    Roz: [surprised] Well, I never thought I'd say this, but: you're on. 

They shake hands, and get up.

  Niles: [excited] Oh, in a funny way this reminds me of that wonderful
         moment in "A Streetcar Named Desire" when the brutish Stanley
         says to the ultra-refined Blanche, "We've had this date with
         each other from the beginning."
    Roz: Well, I don't know the play all that well, but I can tell you
         right now I'm not all that refined.
  Niles: No, actually I was picturing you more as Stanley.

Roz gives Niles a look as they both leave the caf together. 

End Of Act One. (Time: 8:00)

Act Two. 

Scene One - Cabin 
Niles is in his lakefront cottage opening a bottle of wine when Donny 
walks through the front door with his valises.

  Donny: Hi, there.
  Niles: Donny!  I'm so glad you could make it.
  Donny: Well, thanks for inviting me. [looks around] Wow, this is a
         great place to get some work done, with no distractions in 
         sight.  Thank-

Roz enters from the kitchen.

  Niles: Donny, I'd like to introduce... [mock remembering] Oh, that's
         right, you two know each other, don't you? 
  Donny: Roz!  How the hell are you?  Hi!
    Roz: [surprised] Donny! [he kisses her cheek]
  Donny: I didn't know you were going to be here.  Well, this is 
         going to be fun.  Now, Niles, I've got to put these things 
         somewhere...
    Roz: I didn't know you'd be here.
  Niles: Oh yeah, just in one of the bedrooms upstairs. [Donny heads 
         up] Oh, but be careful not to wake Roz's baby.  She's in that 
         first room.
  Donny: Roz, you've got a baby? [she nods] Congratulations!  That 
         means that you're...
  Niles: Married?  No, she's free as a bird! 
  Donny: Well, I'll try to be quiet.

He exits.  Roz then needs to question Niles.

    Roz: What the hell is this?
  Niles: What do you mean?  I just thought you two might enjoy 
         reminiscing about all the good times you've shared...  
    Roz: Oh, no you don't!  Donny is seeing Daphne and I am not the 
         kind who steals other people's boyfriends!  Not friends' 
         boyfriends... not good friends'... [sitting down distraught] 
         Not again! 
  Niles: Roz, you might recall you went out with him for six months.
         She's only seen him three or four times, they're not even
         sleeping together. 
    Roz: What?  How would you know?
  Niles: She told me.  I don't want to be the bad guy here, but you did
         have him first and he did want to make a life with you. 
    Roz: [thinks about it, then] Listen, there is no way that I am  
         going... She hasn't slept with him?
  Niles: She's English.
    Roz: [thinks about it more, then] Why don't you just admit it?  
         You're just doing this because you want Daphne.
  Niles: Yes!  Yes!  Yes, I want Daphne - I think we belong together, 
         just like I think you and Donny belong together, and why 
         should two people be happy when four people can be ecstatic?
    Roz: Well, you got a point there! [then] No!  No, no, no, it's
         just not right!

At this moment Donny walks out of Alice's room carrying a wide-awake 
Alice.

  Donny: Roz, I swear I did not wake her, she was already up when I
         went in to look at her. [mushy] She's got such a sweet little
         face.
    Roz: Her name is Alice.
  Donny: Hi Alice, I'm Donny. 
    Roz: She doesn't usually let strangers hold her.
  Donny: Oh, I've always been pretty good with kids. [to Alice] Come 
         on, sweetie, come on. [exits to bedroom]
    Roz: [to Niles] How's my hair?

Niles gives her a thumbs up, and she follows Donny.  Niles, happy with 
what he has done, takes his glass of wine and sits down on the couch.  
But before he his back has touched the pillow, the door is opened by 
Frasier and Martin.  Frasier is carrying a shopping bag.

Frasier: Niles!
  Niles: Aah! [jumps up startled] Frasier?  Dad?  What are you doing 
         here today?
 Martin: Oh, my dentist is sick, we had to reschedule. 
  Niles: Oh, no!
 Martin: Oh, it's just a head cold.
Frasier: Oh God, you haven't even heard the worst yet, Niles: the 
         butcher shop was closed, so here I am with all my spices, 
         everything I need to make my duck a l'orange - all I've 
         got's the l'orange!

Martin sees the rack of shotguns and hunting gear by the door.

 Martin: Well, looks like we're going to have get our ducks the old-
         fashioned way!  But we better get a move on, there's only a 
         couple hours of daylight left. 
  Niles: Yes, you know, I saw some boxs of ammo in the mud room, Dad, 
         through the kitchen.
Frasier: Are you insane?!  I'm not going to shoot any ducks, it's 
         barbaric!
 Martin: Oh, I get it!  You'll eat them but you won't kill them.  
         What do you think, these things are born "a l'orange?"
	 
He exits to the kitchen.

  Niles: [laughs] Dad does have a point.  You know, there is a duck
         blind right across the lake,  and it would be such a good
         opportunity for you two to bond.
Frasier: Niles, what about you?
  Niles: [takes his bag] Well, I will stay here and season the pans.
Frasier: Well, I'm not going hunting! 
  Niles: Well then you'll just have to drive back to Seattle, find 
         another shop that's open, and come back tomorrow as scheduled! 
Frasier: What the hell is going on?  Are you trying to get rid of us? 

Martin enters with boxes of ammo under his arm.

  Niles: Oh, that's preposterous, why should I be trying to...

Roz enters from the bedroom and realizes the company.

    Roz: Frasier!  Martin!  You weren't supposed to be here until
         tomorrow.
 Martin: Roz, what are you doing here?
    Roz: Niles brought me.  I'm just going to go heat up a bottle for
         Alice. 

Roz exits to the kitchen.  Martin thinks that Niles and Roz are here 
for a date and nudges Niles on the shoulder with a saucy look. 

Frasier: Roz?
  Niles: Roz? [realizing] Roz.  Yes, so why don't you two run along 
         and leave me alone with... [surprised at himself] Roz. 
Frasier: Roz?!
  Niles: Well, didn't you urge me to make a fresh start?
Frasier: True, but I gotta tell you Niles, Roz isn't the freshest start 
         you could make!

For once Niles is the one to leap to Roz's defense, batting Frasier 
on the arm while Frasier shrugs.

 Martin: Now butt out, Frasier, if these two want to be alone together 
         for a while, that's fine.  Now we're going to go hunting, now 
         come on.
Frasier: I'm not going hunting, Dad!  Roz and Niles?!  Please!  
         You guys have nothing in common! 
  Niles: [hands Martin a shotgun] Frasier, we're not getting married. 
         We're going to spend an afternoon together and-and see what 
         comes from it, and... there's nothing wrong with trying 
         something different!
 Martin: [hands Frasier the shotgun] Which is exactly what you're going 
         to do right now!  So come on, let's go get some ducks.
Frasier: Dad...
  Niles: [hands Martin another shotgun and two hunting vests] 
         And please, take as long as you need.
Frasier: I don't want to go hunting!
 Martin: Now, come on!  Didn't you ever hear the expression, "Two's
         company, Three's a crowd"?
Frasier: No Dad, I don't think I ever did, how does it go?!

Frasier and Martin leave, mad with each other through the front door. 
Donny walks downstairs and heads for the front door, Niles stops him:

  Donny: I left some papers in the car.
  Niles: [stops him] Oh, where'd you park?
  Donny: Out back!
  Niles: Ah, then it's best to go through the kitchen because we have a 
         loose plank on the porch.
  Donny: I already came in that way.
  Niles: Yeah, well you cheated death once, don't push your luck! 

As Niles pushes Donny into the kitchen, Frasier enters through the 
front door.

Frasier: Niles, one last warning.  Take it from someone who knows you
         both: you and Roz are not a good couple.
  Niles: I understand you're saying that, but believe me, I have seen 
         a new Roz today and underneath that brazen exterior she is a
         sweet, sensitive, shy, and vulnerable woman. 
    Roz: [calling from kitchen] Niles, have you seen my nipples?!

Niles shrugs at Frasier, who leaves with a look of disgust.  Roz enters 
from the kitchen with Alice's bottles.  The sucking parts of them are 
missing.

  Niles: Uh, no.

FADE TO:

CHICKS AND DUCKS AND
GEESE NEEDN'T WORRY

Scene Two - Duck Blind
Frasier & Martin are in the duck blind.  They both have shotguns and 
Frasier is carrying a duck call.

Frasier: Niles and Roz?  It's just ridiculous!
 Martin: Oh, not this again! 
Frasier: Well, they are just completely incompatible. 
 Martin: Well, haven't you ever heard about "opposites attracting"?  
         I mean, look at your mother and me.  We went together for 
         six months, nobody thought it would last, we had forty happy 
         years together! 
Frasier: Never thought of it that way.
 Martin: Yeah.  And then, there are those relationships where people 
         have a ton of things in common and of course they always 
         work out real well! [laughs]
Frasier: Thank you, Dad, I suppose that was a backhanded comment about
         me and Lilith.
 Martin: [sighting gun] Wouldn't it be great if she was flying by here 
         on her broomstick right now? [they laugh] Come on, sight up.
Frasier: No, no, Dad, I told you I'm not shooting anything.
 Martin: Alright, blow the duck call.
Frasier: Well, all right. [blows duck call twice] Gee, you know, I 
         keep thinking about you and Mom; maybe Niles and Roz do have 
         a chance.
 Martin: Sure they do.  Blow it again.
Frasier: [blows duck call twice] Gosh, you know, I hope I didn't 
         discourage Niles too much by the way I reacted.  You know 
         how much stock he puts in my opinion.
 Martin: Blow it, Frasier.
Frasier: [blows duck call twice]
 Martin: I didn't mean the duck call!

Frasier gives him a look just as Martin catches sight of something 
in the sky and quickly aims his shotgun.  As we FADE OUT we hear a 
gunshot.

DOESN'T ANYONE WANT TO
SEE THE DAMNED SUNSET?

Scene Three - Cabin
Back in the cottage, Roz and Donny are getting on like a house on fire.  
They are laughing and joking about old times when Niles enters carrying 
some nibbles.

  Donny: What about that time in Cancun when the car breaks down and 
         that guy gives us a ride on-
    Roz: A donkey! [they laugh]
  Donny: [to Niles] Oh Niles, you have to hear this... [notices time] 
         Oh God, I didn't realize it had gotten so late.  I have to fax 
         these contracts to the office right away.  You wouldn't happen 
         to have a machine, would you?
  Niles: Well, there's one in the study, it's right down that hall.  
         But can't that wait?  We're all getting so mellow here.
  Donny: You're right, it can wait.  You know what we need?  Another
         bottle of wine, I brought one, I'll get it.
  Niles: Excellent, excellent. 

Donny leaves to the kitchen.  Niles sits with Roz.

  Niles: Well, it's going well, don't you think?
    Roz: Yeah, except your dad and Frasier will be here any minute, and 
         if either one of them sees Donny, things are over.
  Niles: They're not going to see Donny, because you're going to invite 
         him to watch the sunset down by the lake, you're going to 
         continue to work his charms on him, and then you're going to 
         invite him out to dinner, and who knows where that'll lead? 
         [laughs] Well, what am I saying, we both know where that'll 
         lead! 
    Roz: You really think it'll work?
  Niles: Yes, yes, yes.

At this point, unknown to Niles and Roz, Frasier enters and catches 
the rest of the conversation:

  Niles: Now you go down there and you enjoy that romantic sunset.  
         I'll stay here with the baby.
Frasier: Oh, for heaven's sake!  You're not going to let her go down 
         and enjoy the sunset by herself! 
  Niles: Frasier, what are you doing back so soon?
Frasier: I came back for some more ammo.  Who knew ducks were so 
         shifty?  Listen, I know that you took my advice to heart, 
         but I tell you I've changed my mind: I now approve of you 
         and Roz. 
  Niles: What? 
Frasier: Yes, yes, the two of you should go for it.  OK, come on, off
         you two go, let's go. 
  Niles: I don't think this is a good idea.
Frasier: Why not?
    Roz: Yeah, I've changed my mind too, I'd rather stay here.
Frasier: What?  You know what, you guys are putting far too much 
         stock in my opinion.  Come on, let's get down to the lake 
         and enoy that sunset. 
  Niles: But-but-
Frasier: Let's go, no, not another word.  Down to the lake.

Frasier manages to push Niles and Roz out of the front door and 
follows them.  Donny enters from the kitchen with a bottle of wine.

  Donny: OK, I've got a... [no-one's around] 

From her bedroom, Alice starts crying.

  Donny: Alice, it's OK, honey!

Donny puts the wine on the table and runs upstairs.  

After he exits, Frasier enters through the front door and goes to the 
table.  He sniffs the wine and pulls a face before entering the 
kitchen for the extra ammo.  At this point, Niles and Roz enter the 
room again.

  Niles: All right, you wait here, I'll get Donny. [enters kitchen 
         saying] You know, Roz is heading down to the lake to catch 
         that sunset...
Frasier: [pushing Niles back out with him] And you should be going
         with her too!  For God's sake, I told the two of you I 
         withdraw my objection.  Come on, let's go!
    Roz: I'm really worried about leaving Alice here alone.
Frasier: Roz, listen, I will attend to the baby. I was just about to 
         make myself a cup of tea anyway.  Now come on, let's go.  
         March, both of you!  Out the door!  You're going to catch 
         that romantic sunset if I have to drag you down there myself.

Frasier, Roz and Niles leave via the front door as Donny comes back 
out of Alice's room.  He takes his documents and heads down to the fax 
in the hall.  He closes the door behind him.  

Frasier enters back through the front door. 

Frasier: Good lord, I just can't believe the two of them.  Ridiculous
         behavior!  My God... [heads into the kitchen] AAH!

He stumbles out, followed by a newly-arrived Daphne.

Frasier: Daphne!
 Daphne: I'm sorry, did I startle you?
Frasier: No, no, no, no, no.  That's quite alright.  It's just that 
         if Niles knew you were here he would never... well, forgive
         himself for not being here to greet you.
 Daphne: Oh, he wasn't expecting me.  My plans changed and I thought
         I'd drive up and join you all.
Frasier: Oh, well isn't that nice? [then] You've got to leave!
 Daphne: Why?!
Frasier: No, well you see, Niles is up here for what I think you 
         Brits call a "dirty weekend" with someone... 
 Daphne: Ooh... [chuckles] 
Frasier: And the someone happens to be Roz.
 Daphne: Roz?  You mean, Roz Roz?
Frasier: Yes, yes!  Now, you've got to get out of here.
 Daphne: But I just drove two hours and it's getting dark outside!
Frasier: All right, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.  There's a 
         nice bed and breakfast just up the road.  I think Dad, you, 
         and I should all stay there this evening, alright?
 Daphne: All right.  If you don't mind, could I use the bathroom
         first?
Frasier: No, no, of course, right in there.

Daphne enters the bathroom right next to the front door.  
Alice starts crying again. 

Frasier: Oh, dear God.

Frasier runs up the stairs to tend to her.  Meanwhile, Niles and Roz 
re-enter.

    Roz: Where's Donny?
  Niles: Well, he can't be in the kitchen, Frasier would have seen him.
    Roz: [sees the door to Alice's room] Look, the door!  He must be 
         up there.
  Niles: You keep a lookout, I'll go get him.
    Roz: OK.
  Niles: [goes to doorway] Why don't I take over here and you can 
         join Roz?
Frasier: [enters from room] For the love of God!  If I'd known the 
         two of you were gonna take my words this seriously I would 
         have chosen them more carefully.  For God's sake, get out of
         here, get down to that lake! 
    Roz: You know, I really think I should check on Alice.
Frasier: No, no, Roz, your baby is just fine.  I burped her once and 
         she went out like a light.  Come on, let's go, Niles.

Meanwhile, Niles has noticed that Donny is at the fax machine.  So he 
blocks the door to the hall with a large wing chair and sits in it. 
However Donny begins opening it, so Niles shuffles about to cover up 
the sound.

  Niles: Oh, you know, I am thinking about it.  I think it's much 
         more romantic to stay here by the fire than watch some sunset. 
         [Roz joins him] Why don't you clear out so we can 
         have our privacy?
Frasier: [confused] Well, alright. 

He is just about to leave when Daphne opens the bathroom door to 
enter the main room. Frasier pushes her back in and stands in front 
of it.

Frasier: On the other hand, you know, you can enjoy the fire all
         night long.  You've only got ten more minutes for the 
         sunset.

Martin enters from the front door.

 Martin: Are you going to get some ammo while it's still daylight?  
         It's almost sunset.
Frasier: Don't tell me, tell them!
 Martin: [tries to push Frasier away] Is that the bathroom?
Frasier: No. 
  Niles: Yes, it is.
Frasier: It's out of order.

At this point a knocking is heard on the door - Daphne's trying to 
get out.

Frasier: Let me check again.

Frasier opens the door and looks in, making a "sssshh" sound 
which also could be interpreted as a gushing nose.

Frasier: My God, one of the pipes is burst and the other one's 
         knocking. 

Roz and Niles give each other a weird look.

 Martin: Fine, is there one down the hallway there? [points to the
         door Niles is blocking]
  Niles: No.
Frasier: Yes, there is!
  Niles: No, it's out of order too!
 Martin: [mad, to Frasier] Well, it's a good thing I brought all 
         that beer!
Frasier: You know, Niles, you're behaving awfully strangely.  What
         the heck is going on?
  Niles: What do you mean?
Frasier: I mean that you show absolutely no desire to be alone with
         Roz!  I'm starting to have serious doubts about this so-
         called "romance"!
  Niles: Oh, really?  Well, does this look so-called to you? [to Roz]
         Come here, Pookie!

Niles pulls Roz across his lap and gives her a passionate kiss.  
They stop for air before going back for another.  At this point Donny 
walks in through the front door, having gone out through back door, 
and spots the two.

  Donny: That's why the door was stuck.  You two, why didn't you tell
         me?
Frasier: Donny?
 Daphne: [entering from bathroom] Donny?
  Niles: Daphne? [jumps out of his seat, dumping Roz on the ground]
  Donny: Daphne?
Frasier: [to Donny] What are you doing here?
  Donny: Well, Niles invited me.
Frasier: [realizing] Oh, did he?
  Donny: Yeah, it was really nice of him.  Roz and I had a chance to
         catch up on old times.
 Daphne: [remembering, but not angry] Oh, that's right, you two used
         to date, didn't you?
Frasier: Well, isn't that nice of Niles to organize this little 
         reunion?!

Martin and Frasier both look annoyed at Niles and Roz.

 Daphne: I hope I don't have anything to worry about! [laughs]
  Donny: Oh come on, are you kidding? 

Donny and Daphne kiss which causes Roz and Niles to hit each other 
with frustration.

Frasier: Well, [angrily] obviously Roz and Niles can barely keep their 
         HANDS OFF EACH OTHER!  You know, why don't all of us get out 
         of here?  Give these two little kids a little privacy.
 Daphne: [to Donny] You know, we could use some privacy of our own.
         Dr. Crane tells me there's a bed and breakfast up the road
         from here.
  Donny: Really?
 Daphne: [saucily] Really.

Daphne leaves as Niles gapes at them.  Donny stands in the doorway so 
Daphne comes back.

 Daphne: Even more fun if we both go. 
  Donny: Yes, yes.

They leave.

 Martin: Well, come on, Frasier, let's go get a nice Sloppy Joe.  
         I'll pay for it.
Frasier: Something tells me I'll pay for it too. [to Roz & Niles]
         Oh, I realize now that you two don't need my blessing, so
         I'll just leave you with this. 

He blows the duck call at them and leaves.  They both look chagrined.

End Of Act Two. (Time: 21:25)

Credits:

Martin is reading his paper in Frasier's apartment.  Eddie is lying 
next to his Chair.  Martin's hand drifs to the breast pocket of his 
shirt, and he finds the duck call.  He sounds it just for fun, but 
Eddie runs away.  

Martin goes back to reading the paper, but then Eddie comes back and 
drops a rubber duck into Martin's lap.
