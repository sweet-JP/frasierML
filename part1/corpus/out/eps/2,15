Act 1

Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment

[Fade in.  Frasier and Martin are coming in the front door.]

 Martin:  Ah, I still say when some guy grabs your parking space, you 
          don't just sit there, you say something.
Frasier:  Dad, when a man has no front teeth and stitches on his 
          nose, I think it's safe to assume he's sensitive to
          criticism.
 Martin:  [picking up a box]  What's this?
Frasier:  Oh must be one of those inspirational tapes that Daphne's 
          always listening to.  [Daphne comes in from her room.]  Oh, 
          my God, 'Here, Have a Rainbow', by Dr. Honey Snow.  Daphne, 
          how can you listen to this stuff ?  It's absolute dribble.
 Daphne:  Well, for someone who writes dribble, she's awfully 
          popular.
Frasier:  Oh, really, fancy that.  She tells everyone that they're 
          perfectly wonderful and that nothing wrong is ever their 
          fault.  What do you know, they like it.
 Daphne:  There's a lot more to it than that.  You should try reading 
          one of her books.

[Doorbell rings, Frasier goes to get it.]

Frasier:  Yes, well I have.  Believe me, after one page, I was 
          yearning for the worldly cynicism of Barney the Dinosaur.

[He opens the door to reveal Niles.]

Frasier:  Hello, Niles, to what do we owe this pleasure?
  Niles:  Brace yourselves kids, it's raffle time!
Frasier:  Oh, God .
 Martin:  Not again
  Niles:  Fraid so.  [notices tape]  Oh ye gods, who's been plumbing 
          the shallows of Dr. Honey Snow?
 Daphne:  I have.
  Niles:  Insightful, isn't she?  [Daphne is not amused.]  Anyway, 
          tickets are only ten dollars, it all goes to support Maris' 
          little opera group.
Frasier:  Dear God, what's the grand prize this year?
  Niles:  Their lead soprano, Mrs. Fitzgibbons, will come to your 
          home and perform 'The Ride of the Valkyres'.  We've sold 
          eight hundred tickets, so the risk is pretty minimal.
Frasier:  All right.
  Niles:  In return, let me offer you a hot stock tip:  VectorComp 
          Software.  Wendel assures me they can't miss.
 Martin:  Who's Wendel?
  Niles:  My new broker.  Every stock he's put me onto has paid off.  
          The man is positively clairvoyant.
 Daphne:  You know, I've got a bit tucked away.  Maybe I ought to 
          take a little chance with your Wendel.
  Niles:  I should warn you, it's not a sure thing. 
 Daphne:  Oh, nothing in life is a sure thing, but Dr. Snow has a 
          little saying:  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Frasier:  She better copyright that before some unscrupulous hack 
          steals it.
 Daphne:  I'll go in for five hundred.  That's a lot for me, but I 
          don't know; I have a little feeling I'm in for a bit of 
          luck.  All right, I better get ready.  I'm off the the Book 
          Nook.  Dr. Snow is signing copies of her new best seller.
 Martin:  Hey, wait a minute.  You're going out?  What about my 
          whirlpool therepy?
 Daphne:  Oh, right, I forgot.  Maybe you could go to the book 
          signing for me, Dr. Crane.  It's right around the corner 
          from the station.
Frasier:  I would sooner attend a ho-down.
  Niles:  I would gladly go, but I've got my compulsive spending 
          seminar, and I'm hoping to unload the rest of these raffle 
          tickets.
 Martin:  What's the big deal?
Frasier:  I have my reputation to think of.
  Niles:  What's the big deal?
Frasier:  All right, if it will make you all happy to see me 
          humiliate myself.
 Martin:  I always get a kick out of it.
 Daphne:  Thanks ever so.
Frasier:  [noticing Eddie rolling around on the floor]  Oh, look 
          everyone!  Eddie has found his inner puppy!

[Fade out.]

Scene 2 - The Book Nook

ARE THERE ANY MORE LIKE
YOU AT THE INSTITUTE?

[Fade in.  Roz and Frasier enter.]

Frasier:  I promise this'll just take a minute.
    Roz:  Well, I hope so, I barely got an hour for lunch.  Oh, God, 
          not another one of those Honey Snow books.
Frasier:  [reading the cover]  'Don't Change, You're Perfect'
    Roz:  Can you believe people go for this junk?
Frasier:  It's unbelievable.  Here, get her autograph for me, will 
          ya?  [Roz gives him a 'What?!' look]  She's sitting right 
          behind those people over there.  Just go get it signed and 
          then we'll get out of here,  go have a nice lunch at Le 
          Cigare Volant.
    Roz:  Me?  Why don't you do it?
Frasier:  I have my reputation to think of!
    Roz:  Oh, what's the big deal?  [off his glare]  All right.

[He picks up another copy and looks it over.  A woman comes up.]

  Woman:  Oh, it's wonderful isn't it?  I just love what she says 
          about finding a moment each day to stop and give yourself a 
          mental hug.
Frasier:  I'm giving myself one now.
  Woman:  Really?
Frasier:  Welll actually it's more of a Heimlich manuever.

[Roz comes back.]

    Roz:  Got it.
Frasier:  Good, good.  Let's buy it and get out of here.
    Roz:  Nope, nope, not so fast.  She wants to meet you.  
Frasier:  Roz, I don't want to meet the woman, let's just go.
    Roz:  Uh, Frasier, do you know what Honey Snow looks like?
Frasier:  What difference could that make?  The woman stands for 
          everything that I find totally...

[Dr. Honey Snow walks up.  She is tall, blonde and buxom.]

Frasier:  ...enchanting.
  Honey:  Hello.  I'm Dr. Honey Snow.
Frasier:  And I'm...wait, don't tell me, Dr. Frasier Crane.
  Honey:  Well, Dr. Crane let me shake your hand.  Oh, what am I 
          saying?  Hug.
Frasier:  Why not?  [They hug.]
  Honey:  After all, a handshake is just a hug for fraidy cats.
Frasier:  No fear here.
  Honey:  I am one of your biggest fans
Frasier:  I've recently become one of yours.
    Roz:  You know, I think I'll just go get started on my appitizer.
Frasier:  Oh, yes, you start without me.  All I really want is a 
          little nibble.
    Roz:  Oh, tell me.
  Honey:  You know, I really should get back to my signing, but I'd 
          love to talk more.  There seems to be such a positive 
          energy betwen us.  My publisher is giving me a dinner 
          tonight at seven at Bianchi's.  Would you come as my guest?
Frasier:  I'd love to 
  Honey:  Well that's great.
Frasier:  Well it was nice meeting you Dr. Snow.
  Honey:  Oh, please, it's Honey.  [She goes back to the signing.]
Frasier:  It certainly is...

[Fade out.]

Scene 3 - Frasier's Apartment

YOU SCRATCH MY BOOK...

[Fade in.  Martin is watching a horse race on television.  Daphne 
opens the door for Niles.]

Daphne:  Good evening, Dr. Crane.
 Niles:  Good evening Daphne, Dad.  Ooh, watching the sport of kings 
         I see.  Which horse did you wager on?
Martin:  Gerald's Dream, number eight.
 Niles:  Goodness, he seems to be taking a serene, almost Buddhist 
         approach to the race.

[Marin, disgusted, turns off the set.]

 Niles:  Perhaps you should have invested in something more reliable.  
         Like VectorComp Software.
Daphne:  Our stock.  Did it go up a bit?
 Niles:  No, it went up a lot.  Thanks to a takeover bid, it gained 
         forty percent overnight.  Wendel advised selling, so, voila, 
         your original five hundred investment plus two hundred 
         profit.  [He gives her a check.]
Daphne:  Two hundred?  Oh, Dr. Crane, I could kiss you!  [She kisses 
         him on the cheek and hugs him tightly.  Niles is stunned.]
Martin:  Oh, that's a nice little dividend.
 Niles:  [sitting downon the arm of the couch]  I'll say.
Daphne:  You have to help me decide what to do with it.
 Niles:  Well, you might want to consider letting Wendel reinvest it.  
         That's what I'm doing.  It's called rolling it over.

[Frasier comes in.]

 Daphne:  Then I'll do it.  Oh, this is so exciting.
Frasier:  What's all this?
 Daphne:  Well, your brother just gave me two hundred dollars, and 
          now he's going to roll me over.
Frasier:  Niles?
  Niles:  Communications breakdown
Frasier:  Good.
  Niles:  What are you all dressed for.  Hot date?
Frasier:  As a matter of fact, yes.
  Niles:  With whom?
 Martin:  Dr. Honey Snow.
  Niles:  You're dating Dr. Honey Snow?  I thought you considered her 
          a complete ninny.  What could you possibly see in this 
          [Martin hold up the dust jacket photo] whoa-hoa mama!
 Martin:  One hell of a cute shrink, huh?  Not a man alive wouldn't 
          let her analyze his dreams.
Frasier:  Analyze them? She could star in them.
  Niles:  Yes, yes, but what on Earth do you say to her when she 
          wants to discuss her work?
Frasier:  Well, I just simply skirt the issue.
  Niles:  Of course.  'Honey I think your books are just - oh look!  
          The waiter's on fire!'

[The doorbell rings, Frasier goes to get it.]

Frasier: You're just jealous.  But not half as jealous as you're 
         about to be.  I suggest you get a coaster for your lower 
         lip.

[He opens the door, it is Honey.]

  Honey:  Hi, honey.
Frasier:  Hi, Honey. Allow me to make the introductions.  Daphne 
          Moon, Honey Snow;  Honey Snow, Daphne Moon.  She's a big 
          fan of yours.
   Both:  Hug!  [they hug]
 Daphne:  We've both got sort of unusual names.  Daphne Moon, Honey 
          Snow.  Come to think of it, if you married my father, 
          you're name would be Honey Moon.

[Frasier, exasperated, sort of shoos her away.]

Frasier:  My father, Martin Crane.
  Honey:  Oh, hello.  Well it's easy to see where Frasier gets his 
          good looks.
 Martin:  Ah, get outta here.
Frasier:  And, last but not least, my brother Niles.
  Honey:  Oh, Dr. Niles Crane.  I read a wonderful article you wrote 
          in the Journal of Psychiatric Medicine.  Let's see:  
          'Gestalt Therepy, Probing the Subconscious'.
  Niles:  Yes.  And I believe I read your quiz in Cosmo:  'Is Your 
          Guy a Stud or a Dud?'
Frasier:  Perhaps we should be going.
  Honey:  Well, actually, not yet.  I have something I want to give 
          you.
Frasier:  Oh?
  Honey:  [handing him a box]  It's a manuscript of my upcoming book.
Frasier:  Oh.  Another one?  So soon? 
  Honey:  I hope you like it Frasier.  Because if you do, I'd love 
          for you to write the foreword.
Frasier:  Me?
  Niles:  [taking the manuscript]  Who better?
Frasier:  Well, actually there's so many other people that would be 
          more qualified to write for such an important work.
  Honey:  Well, if I didn't know better, I'd think you didn't want to 
          do it.
Frasier:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  It's a great honor.
 Daphne:  I'll say.  The last book had an introduction by Mickey 
          Rooney.
 Martin:  Wow.
Frasier:  Well there's no two ways about it, then.  I'm writing that 
          foreword.
  Honey:  Oh, that's great.
 Daphne:  Just think.  By next fall there'll be half a million copies 
          in print with your name right on the cover.
  Niles:  I've got my Christmas shopping done!

[Frasier gives him a dark look as he leaves with Honey.  Fade out.]

Act 2

Scene 1 - Frasier's Apartment

SHRINK RAP

[Frasier is typing on his laptop.  Niles is reading Honey's 
manuscript, laughing.]

Frasier:  Niles, will you please stop giggling?  It's very 
          distracting.
  Niles:  I can't help it.  Have you read this?
Frasier:  I'm trying to recommend the book.  Reading it doesn't help.  
          OK, here, how's this:  Many great volumes have been written 
          about human behavior.  And I can honestly say, without fear 
          of contradiction, that this book can stand on the shelf 
          next to any of them.  [off Niles' look] No good, is it?
  Niles:  No, no but this is:  [reading from the manuscript]  You 
          don't have to be a star to twinkle.  Frasier, I need a hug.
Frasier:  Oh, Niles, will you please help me?  Honey asked me to 
          write this foreword two weeks ago, she's got a deadline, 
          she's been wondering where it is.
  Niles:  Time is a concept known only to one of God's creatures:  
          man.  Just for today, be a sunflower.  [points to a 
          paragraph in the manuscript]
Frasier:  Oh, give me that!  Nies you just don't understand what's at 
          stake here.  I've never felt this way about a woman before.  
          I'm out of control, her effect on me, it's, it's. there are 
          no words to describe it, really, it's more like a sound... 
          [makes a growling noise] 

[Martin comes in with Eddie.]

 Martin:  Talkin' about Honey again?
Frasier:  Yes.
  Niles:  Frankly, I find it laughable that you're even considering 
          putting you name on five hundred thousand copies of this 
          piffle.  Not even piffle.  It's piffle light.

[Daphne comes in wearing a nice coat and carryin shopping bags.]

 Daphne:  Oh, good, you're all here.  I want to show off me new coat.
Frasier:  Very nice Daphne.
 Daphne:  Yes, I've been spending like a drunken yuppie.  Oh, I'm 
          afraid I went a bit over me budget.
  Niles:  Well, if it's cash flow you're concerned about, you should 
          know I got a little call from Wendel today.
 Martin:  What, again?  What's that, four times in two weeks?
  Niles:  Yes, the man's a wizard.  Daphne, your profit.  [gives her 
          a check]
 Daphne:  Four hundred dollars?  Oh, Dr. Crane!  [She kisses him.]  
          And here's one for Wendel.  [She kisses his other cheek.]
  Niles:  Did I mention Wendel has a secratary?  [He puckers up.]
 Daphne:  Oh, you!  [Swats him on the stomach.]
 Martin:  Well, I'd say this calls for a celebration.
 Daphne:  Tell you what, I'll take you all out for a nice dinner, my 
          treat.  I'll just go and put on me new dress and we'll be
          off.  I want you to put on your new shirt with your brown 
          courdroy slacks.  [She heads to her room.]
 Martin:  Hey, if you're payin', I'm gonna wear elastic waist pants 
          and no belt.  [He heads to his room.]
Frasier:  Well, Niles, that broker of yours, he's a marvel!
  Niles:  Yes, he's doing wonderful things for me.
Frasier:  Yes, I'd say so.  I've been so impressed with his winning 
          streak lately that I asked Daphne what her latest pick was, 
          I invested a few hundred myself.
  Niles:  Really?  Well, congratulations.
Frasier:  Thank you.  But there's just one thing, though, it's very
          hard to figure out.  Allthough I invested in the very same 
          stock that Daphne did, mine declined and hers went up.  How 
          do you explain that?
  Niles:  Obviously, one of us is lying, Frasier.  What are you up 
          to?
Frssier:  Fess up, Niles, this whole stock thing was a lie from the 
          get go.
  Niles:  No, no, that's not true.  The first stock really did pay 
          off, but then the rest all tanked.  And what was I supposed 
          to do?  Tell that poor, working class Venus I'd lost her 
          life savings?  I had to pay her back and I threw in a 
          little extra, and where's the harm in that?
Frasier:  Niles, you are giving a woman money to obtain physical 
          affection.  We are talking the world's oldest profession.  
          Granted, this is sort of the Walt Disney version, but 
          still.  It's wrong, and I insist you stop it.
  Niles:  No.  It's altruistic, it's noble, it's fun, and you can't 
          make me stop.
 Daphne:  [coming back out]  Well, Dr. Crane, I want you to take this 
          four hundred dollars back and buy whatever Wendel says.
  Niles:  Consider it done.

[Martin comes out.]

Frasier:  You know, Niles, I've been thinking maybe I should get on 
          that gravy train myself.  Tell Wendel I'm in for ten 
          thousand.
 Daphne:  Good lord, ten thousand dollars, Dr. Crane?
Frasier:  Yes, well just think of the dinner I'll be able to buy when 
          Niles brings me my profits.
 Martin:  Well, what the hell, put me down for a couple of hundred.  
          This guy's some kind of genie!
  Niles:  Yes, he's a real treasure, isn't he?  I only hope those 
          chest pains he was complaining about this morning turn out
          to be indigestion.
 Daphne:  So, shall we go then?  I've decided on Farmer Jack's 
          Chicken, Chicken, Chicken.  I hear the chicken there is 
          very good.
 Martin:  Are you comin'?
  Niles:  Oh, you two run along.  I'll take my car.  [Daphne and 
          Martin leave.]  Well, I hope you're happy.
Frasier:  Snap out of it.  What you were doing was completely 
          dishonest. 
  Niles:  Said the pot to the kettle!  
Frasier:  What is that supposed to mean?
  Niles:  I think you know what it means.
Frasier:  Don't be ridicoulous!  Our two situations are completely 
          different.
  Niles:  Oh, really?  How so?
Frasier:  Well, for one thing, you've been misleading a woman for 
          your own selfish gain.
  Niles:  And so are you!
Frasier:  Well, I'm not finished.  She was also trusting you to tell 
          the truth.
  Niles:  Oh, and the difference would be?
Frasier:  Your woman is English!
  Niles:  Frasier, you've lost this one.
Frasier:  I know.  I know.  Just going to take a little while to 
          climb down off of this particular high horse.
  Niles:  I think you know what you have to do.
Frasier:  Yes.  I have to tell her I can't write the foreword.  Oh, 
          Niles, and I have to say goodbye to the chance of ever 
          sleeping with absolute perfection.  Oh, where oh, where 
          will I ever have the chance again to gaze upon such 
          extraordinary proud and supple breasts?
  Niles:  Not to worry brother, that's the manager's special at 
          Farmer Jack's Chicken, Chicken, Chicken.

[Fade out.]

Scene 2 - Honey's Apartment

[Fade in.  Honey and Frasier come in, Frasier waits at the door.]

  Honey:  That was a wonderful dinner, thank you.
Frasier:  Yes, well thank you for the fabulous table.  I think 
          hugging the maitre d' really clinched it.
  Honey:  Would you care for a night cap?
Frasier:  Sure.  [He comes in.]
  Honey:  You know, you seemed really tense all evening.  But I have 
          just the thing.  It's a sandlewood candle.  The scent is 
          guaranteed to calm you down.
Frasier:  You better fire up about ten of those.  You know, there's 
          something I'd really like to talk to you about. It's about 
          that foreword I've been trying to write for you.
  Honey:  Can we not talk about work tonight, Frasier?  I've been 
          chained to my desk all day researching an article I'm doing 
          on sexual intimacy.  I am up to here with 'The Joy of Sex', 
          'Karma Sutra', Masters and Johnson...
Frasier:  Really?
  Honey:  I feel like I've been reading recipes all day, only there 
          are no groceries in the house.
Frasier:  Well, your bag-boy has arrived.  [They kiss.]  No, no, no, 
          I really need to discuss this now.
  Honey:  Oh, you.  You are such a workaholic.  I only hope you're 
          this tireless about everything.
Frasier:  Oh, I don't think you'll have any complaints.  [He starts 
          to take his tie off.]  No, no, no, I've got to focus on the
          subject at hand.
  Honey:  Frasier, tonight I am the subject at hand.  [They start to 
          make out and fall to the couch.]
Frasier:  No, no, Honey, I can't do it!
  Honey:  Oh, that's all right, I have a candle for that too.
Frasier:  No, no, I, I can't write the foreword.
  Honey:  Well, why not?
Frasier:  Well, I, I just didn't think it was a very good book.  I 
          think the world of you and I wish you the greatest success, 
          but I didn't think the book was good enough to put my name 
          on it.  I guess I'l be going now.
  Honey:  I am so attracted to you right now.  Most men are so eager 
          to have sex they'll say anything to a woman.  How great to 
          meet a man who would risk rejection rather than be 
          dishonest?
Frasier:  Well, I, uh...have to be true to my inner voice.
  Honey:  You know, frankly I thought the book was weak myself.  I 
          rushed it to meet a deadline.  I am so glad you respected 
          me enough to be honest.  I think honesty is the greatest 
          aphrodesiac of all.
Frasier:  I hope you feel you can be just as honest to me.
  Honey:  Oh, I do, I do.  Tell me everything.  I don't want us to 
          hide anything.
Frasier:  I thought your chapter titles were clumsy and jejune.  Your 
          turn.
  Honey:  You use way too much French in everyday conversation.  You 
          go.
Frasier:  I think that sandlewood stinks.
  Honey:  Oh, when you talk about wine, I wish I had a gun.
Frasier:  I thought your first three books were trite and saccharin.  
          [She freezes.]  It's your turn Honey.  Honey?
  Honey:  [pulling away]  I am immensely proud of my first three 
          books.
Frasier:  As well you should be. 
  Honey:  You thought they were trite?
Frasier:  Oh, well, I meant trite in its best sense.  As in the 
          phrase 'trite and true'.
  Honey:  And what about saccharin?
Frasier:  I love saccharin.  Use it every day.
  Honey:  Well, I'm glad you like saccharin, darling, because there's 
          no way you're getting any honey.   Good night Frasier.

[She gets up and holds the door open.]

Frasier:  Honey, I'm sorry, I really am.  Couldn't we try one of your 
          foregiveness excercises?
  Honey:  Good night, Frasier.
Frasier:  Hug?
  Honey:  You know a poet once said something about the world that I
          think applies to our relationship:  'It ends, not with a 
          bang, but with a whimper.'

[Frasier whimpers.  Fade out.]

Credits:

Daphne, Martin, Frasier and Niles sit on the couch, dumbfounded.  We 
pan across to Mrs. Fitzgibbons, belting out Wagner, in costume.  We 
continue panning to find Eddie apparently trying to dig a hole in 
Martin's chair to hide in.
